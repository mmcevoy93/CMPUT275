Write code that reads from the standard input a string of length at least one and prints the first and last characters of the string to the standard output.

The code should not print anything else to the standard output (i.e., when using input() to get the string from the standard input, do not add a prompt).

You will need to submit your code separately on the code submission page.

Example 1:

Input

abc

Output

ac

Example 2:

Input

Hello

Output

Ho


Write code that reads from the standard input a string and prints the number of upper-case characters in the string to the standard output.  Hint: there's a method on strings that will tell you if a character is upper or lower case.
The code should not print anything else to the standard output (i.e., when using input() to get the string from the standard input, do not add a prompt).
